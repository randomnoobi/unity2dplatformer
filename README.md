# unity2dplatformer
my first attempt to make a unity 2d platformer, it is unfinished.

the movement script should go on the player, then you have to create a empty GameObject and place it on the feet of the player, make sure it is bigger than the collider. Repeat this process but put the second GameObject onto the side of the character. Then, drag the GameObjects into the script so it can detect for walls and the groud. Remeber to set the ground and wall layer as well.

camera movement should go on the main camera remeber to drag the player into the script.
